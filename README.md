# CompoundInterestCalculator
A Python-based compound interest calculator with flexible input handling
## Overview

This project is a Python-based command-line tool for calculating compound interest over a given number of years. It allows flexible input handling using object-oriented principles and dynamic type conversion. The tool can calculate final amounts, base amounts required to reach a target, and monthly contributions needed to achieve a savings goal.

As shown in the screenshot above, the calculator offers a simple user interface where users can enter values for the base amount, monthly contributions, number of years, and interest rate. Depending on the calculation type selected (Final amount, Monthly contribution, or Base amount), the tool will compute and display the result accordingly.

## Features

- Compound interest calculation with optional monthly contributions.
- Calculate base amount needed to reach a final savings goal.
- Calculate monthly contributions needed to reach a target amount.
- Flexible input handling with type coercion and validation.
